- Achieves <100ms end-to-end latency

### Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Spring Boot (Java 17)
- **Event Streaming:** Apache Kafka
- **ML:** XGBoost (Python training, Java inference)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Cache:** Redis
- **Frontend:** React

## 💡 Key Concepts Explained

### What is Kafka?
Message queue that buffers transactions between producer and consumer. Think of it as a super-fast conveyor belt for data.

### What is XGBoost?
Machine learning algorithm that learns patterns from historical fraud data. Pre-built library - you don't write ML math from scratch.

### What is Feature Engineering?
Extracting meaningful signals from raw data (e.g., "5 transactions in 1 hour" becomes a velocity feature).

### What is Redis?
In-memory cache that stores frequently accessed data for super-fast lookups (sub-millisecond).

## 🎓 Learning Approach

### The 80/20 Rule
- 20% reading/watching tutorials
- 80% hands-on coding

### Build Small, Build Often
- Week 0: Build 4 tiny projects (REST API, Kafka, etc.)
- Weeks 1-8: Add features incrementally, test constantly

### Test-Driven Development
1. Write test first (what should it do?)
2. Write minimal code to pass test
3. Refactor if needed
4. Repeat

---

## 🚨 Important Reminders

### Before You Start
- ✅ Install all tools (Docker, IntelliJ, Postman, DBeaver)
- ✅ Create GitHub account
- ✅ Allocate 12-15 hours per week
- ✅ Read QUICK_START.md completely

### During the Build
- 💾 Commit to Git daily
- 📝 Update learning journal
- 🧪 Test each component before moving on
- 🆘 Ask for help if stuck >4 hours

### When Behind Schedule
- ⏱️ Use buffer time (16 hours built-in)
- 📉 Simplify scope if needed
- 🎯 Focus on core features first
- 🔄 Extend timeline if necessary

---

## 🏆 Success Criteria

You're done when:
1. ✅ System works end-to-end (can demo)
2. ✅ You can explain every component
3. ✅ Documentation is complete
4. ✅ You're interview-ready (can discuss confidently)
